# Syntax Tree Visualizer

This Visual Studio Code extension visualizes syntax trees and maps them to the source they have been constructed from.
To view the syntax tree of a document, a corresponding syntax tree provider for the language mode of the document has to be installed.
A syntax tree provider for TypeScript is already shipped with this extension.
